                <h2>Quaid-e-Azam: The Architect of Pakistan
                </h2>
                <p><b>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah</b> was the visionary leader who turned the dream of a separate Muslim state into reality. His determination, leadership, and unwavering commitment to the cause of Pakistan made him the true architect of the nation. Through his speeches, negotiations, and political strategies, he united the Muslims of the subcontinent under one banner. Jinnah strongly believed in democracy, justice, and equal rights for all citizens, regardless of their religion or background. Despite facing immense challenges from the British and the Indian National Congress, he remained steadfast in his mission. His efforts culminated in the creation of Pakistan on August 14, 1947, fulfilling the aspirations of millions. Even today, his principles serve as a guiding light for the nation’s progress and unity.
